# NeuralNetwork
Home assignment in the subject of learning systems, discussed in Artificial Intelligence university course.
The task was to model the structure and learning process of artificial neural networks. The final structure was put to the test, we used it for an email classification task to see its efficiency(not included). 

The different "Solution X" Eclipse projects are not independent, as there are files which are common.
Therefore the projects can't be downloaded and used alone.
